## BUFFER WALKER
A simple Neovim plugin that lets you walk back and forward through previously visited buffers â€” like browser-style back/forward navigation.

## âœ¨ Features
- Maintains two stacks to enable both forward and backward navigation
- Navigate **backward** to the previously visited buffer.
- Navigate **forward** after going back.
- Skips invalid or closed buffers automatically.
- Prevents infinite loops when switching buffers with the plugin.
